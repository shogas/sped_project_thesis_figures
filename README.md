# Project thesis figures
Code for generating the figures for my project thesis as part of TFY4520 Nanotechnology Specialization Project at NTNU. Data is generated using https://github.com/shogas/sped_processing_pipeline. The code for generating Tikz figures (`figure.py`) probably deserves a separate repository, some documentation and a more unified API. Otherwise, the code is very specific for my report.

See `do_all.bat` for examples how the different scripts are run.
